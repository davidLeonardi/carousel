Experimental image carousel module for dojox.image that leverages on dojo.store and has lots of nice feautures.

Most notable feautures:
-Automatic resizing of images based on parent domnode size. Never specify height/width again!
-Image sets allow to seamlessly and effortlessly switch from one set of images as you please
-Unlimited metadata fields per image
-Add images directly from DOM. Soon to support json or another dojo.store !
-Html5 compliant
-Soon to have Video support too! [open for suggestions on this one]
-Soon to have pluggable image transitions [open for suggestions on this one]
-Soon to have separate modules providing controls for the carousel [open for suggestions on this one]
